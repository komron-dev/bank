# Ongoing pet project about bank (not completed)

A simple banking service that offers APIs to support:
	1.	Creating and managing bank accounts, each including the account holderâ€™s name, balance, and currency type.
	2.	Logging all balance updates for every account, ensuring that each deposit or withdrawal generates a new record.
	3.	Facilitating money transfers between two accounts, using transactions to ensure that both accounts are updated successfully or, if an issue occurs, no changes are made.
